📊 Sales Data Visualization using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on transforming monthly sales data into meaningful insights using data visualization techniques. The goal is to understand sales performance, trends over time, and the relationship between units sold and revenue through clear visual representations.
This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship – Task 3 (Data Visualization).

🎯 Objectives

Convert raw data into visual insights

Analyze monthly sales trends and revenue patterns

Compare performance across months

Build professional visualizations for decision-making

Gain hands-on experience with Python data analytics tools

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Programming language

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib – Basic data visualization

Jupyter Notebook / Command Prompt – Interactive development environment

📂 Dataset Description
Month	Units Sold	Revenue
Jan	120	24000
Feb	150	30000
Mar	180	36000
Apr	170	34000
May	200	40000

The dataset represents monthly sales and revenue of a company over five months.

📊 Visualizations Implemented

1️⃣ Bar Chart – Units Sold per Month

Compares sales performance across months

Identifies months with highest and lowest units sold

2️⃣ Line Chart – Revenue Trend Over Months

Shows revenue changes over months

Useful for identifying growth trends

3️⃣ Scatter Plot – Units Sold vs Revenue

Shows relationship between units sold and revenue

Helps identify correlation between sales volume and revenue

🔍 Key Insights

Units Sold and Revenue increase steadily over months

May has the highest sales and revenue

Positive correlation between units sold and revenue

April saw a slight dip in units sold and revenue compared to March

✅ Results

The project successfully demonstrates how data visualization can:

Simplify raw numerical data

Reveal sales trends and correlations

Support data-driven business decisions

Improve understanding of sales performance

📈 Learning Outcomes

Learned how to create a Pandas DataFrame from raw data

Gained experience using Matplotlib for different chart types

Understood the importance of visual insights in analytics

Built a complete GitHub-ready data visualization project

🚀 Future Enhancements

Use a larger dataset for more robust insights
